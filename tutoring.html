            <h1>Paid Tutoring</h1>
            <p>Paid tutoring is an available option for students who want 1-on-1 help in the following subjects. My promise to you is that I will understand your weakness that you bring to me, and I will work with you until I believe that you have a grasp on what's going on. </p>
            <p>Paid tutoring costs $25 for an hour, and includes a post-session wrap-up document that I will write and send to you. It will highlight what we went over and any tips that you can use to study with.</p>
            <!-- List of subjects I can tutor -->
            <li>CS 1010: Python Basics</li>
            <li>CS 1301: Computer Science Fundamentals (Java)</li>
            <div class="free-tutoring">
                <h2>Free Tutoring</h2>
                <p>Additionally, if you are a CS 1301 student at VSU, I am a class facilitator and I'm helping with Dr. Roy's classes! I am paid by the university to do this, so it's completely free for VSU CS1301 students! </p>
                <p>Note: This is group tutoring and not 1-on-1.</p>

            <h3>How to prepare for 1-on-1 tutoring</h3>
            <p>When preparing for a tutoring session, you should have a clear goal in mind. For instance, if you are unsure about for-loops in Java, you should let me know that you know so far about them and what your pain points are. If you're unsure about what you do or don't know on a specific subject, share what you think you know! This will help me to narrow down the issue and help you to hammer out the problem going forward. I will also gladly make example problems for us to go over!</p>
            <h3>How to schedule a session</h3>
            <p>Email me via the contact form on this website, or contact me through LinkedIn.</p>
            <h3>WARNING</h3>
            <p>I WILL NOT DO YOUR HOMEWORK OR PROJECT.</p>
